[x] players: 3
[x] hexgrid (hexes are cute)
[x] robots ~~with wide abilities,~~ which they late rspecialize
[x] optimism level influences the whole game (like luck)
[x] action cards: positive and negative
[x] dice roll to avoid negative action, chance dependent on optimism level
[x] ability to place a cat after round ends, chance dependent on optimism level
[x] no max cats per hex, but max numbre of cats = (number of hexes * 1.5).floor()
[x] 1 round = all players using their action points
[x] players get action points at the start of round, each rolls a d10
[x] number of cats amplify the action cards, effect written on action card
[x] corruption levels in each tile
[x] corruption: 1D6 per resource, higher skill level required to work with resource
[x] corruption does not spread, only acts as a gatekeeper for skill levels
[x] 1 corruption level = 1 skill level
[x] skill level trading between players
[x] trading can only be done when players are in the same hex
[x] 1 trade per AP
[x] 1 skill level per trade
[x] each player starts with 3 skill points; needs to distribute in {water, plant, animal}
[x] 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% optimism give 1 more point to each player to specialize

[x] action points, number depends on optimism level 1 + chance, eg: 0 to 1 move if 10% optimism, 0 to 2 moves if 20% optimism, 1 to 2 moves if 30% optimism, 1 to 3 moves if 40% optimism, 1 to 4 moves if 50% optimism, 2 to 4 moves if 75% optimism, 3 to 4 moves if 90% optimism, 4 moves if 95% optimism
[x] --- optimism is like the opposite of depression
[x] 1 action point: move to another hex, draw 1 action card, save one action card for later, transmute
[x] negative cards apply automatically
~~[ ] negative cards apply corruption in current hex~~
~~[ ] positive cards remove corruption~~

[x] obtain raw resources by using action points on tile, 3 AP to get 100%, each tile gives 3 resources, 1 for each AP, max 3 AP

[x] transmute raw resource into refined resources
[x] raw resource: garbage (always 3 per hex)
[x] refined resources: ~~rock matter,~~ plant matter, animal matter, ~~neutrients,~~ water

[x] 3 resources per hex

[x] 1 resource = contained,
[x] 2 resource = spill into 3 hex decided by player,
[x] 3 resource = spill into all neighbors

[x] water: allows plants and animals to live
[x] plant: plants
[x] animal: animals

[x] draw all the refined resources on the map, spillover is shown with the drawing

[x] win condition: transmute all garbage into refined resources, and you get a cool map :3
[x] lose condition: dont have fun (no lose condition)

map:
   HHH
  HHHHH
 HHHHHHH
  HHHHH
   HHH

[x] gameplay flow:

[x] start of game:
[x] each player selects skill points
[x] they all start on corner of hex, decided by them

[x] each round:
[x] each player rolls dice, gets AP
[x] strategise on how to spend their AP
[x] round ends, roll for cat
