  abstract: [
    This essay examines the board game "Re:Build Nature", which was loosely made using the MDA framework with strong influence from @fpod. The aim of this essay is to reflect on the board game's results and the process of making it as a person who isn't creative. It goes through some of the problems I faced and how I overcame them. This essay focuses on three problems in @cdp, and my thought process behind the decisions made for them.

#explanation(detail: "and what I believe")[
  = Introduction
]

I am not a creative person. I believe that designing is a muscle that can be trained by (not blindly)copying, analyzing, and then remixing the work of others. I believe that there's always a lesson to be learnt. So, how did I design my game?

#explanation(detail: "Expanding the possibilities")[
  = Getting started<gs>
]

I started by checking the defination in dictionary, but found nothing. Optimism is a feeling, so I started thinking about the moments I feel optimism, and the anti-thesis of optimism, depression. I say moments because people only remember the peaks, and peaks only last a moment. Then I asked my friends about what they thought the game could have.

#explanation(detail: "Condensing the possibilities")[
  = Core Design Philosophies<cdp>
]

== "Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game."
I need to make sure that the optimal path is the fun path. I am guilty of this as well. However, this is supposed to be a cooperative board game. What does winning mean in this context? Does it even make sense to have a win state in the game? #[#link("https://www.minecraft.net/en-us")[Minecraft]<links>] doesn't have one.

I used to play Minecraft with friends back in school. Killing the ender dragon triggers ending credits. However, to most people, that's not the point, it's more about having fun.

Playing a cooperative and creative game brings people together. Thus, I decided that the game shouldn't have an explicit win condition, and just like Minecraft, I decided that the "win condition" should be the memories.

== Giving the players more control
Nerfing people's abilities always leaves a sour taste. My goal was to ensure players felt in control of their choices and had an external factor for negative results.

Action points lets the players get to decide what to do with, while also limiting how much they can do.

Negative action cards exist as scapegoat for bad rounds.

== Gambling? Or optimism?<goo>
My friend Em√Ω suggested a push-your-luck game, as she thought optimism is hoping for improbable outcome, however, as an ex-gatcha game player, it felt too close to gambling.

I thought about rogue-likes and rogue-lites, how do they deal with it? In #[#link("https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/")[Brotato]<links>], you get higher tier items surviving more waves, you are guarenteed to get higher stats by leveling up, and it has a higher chance of giving you more weapons of same category.

So, action points scale with optimism and cat tokens exist as scalers to action cards.

#explanation(detail: "Expanding and then condensing the scope")[
  = Goals and non-goals<gang>
]

There were a lot of ideas, but what I could use were not only limited by the medium of the game, but also by the page limit for the assignment. So, I had work within those limitations. Also, a strong core is better than multiple underdeveloped ideas. It's also better to add a strong core, rather than removing and suffering backlash.

= Final Words
I hasn't played that many board games, let alone board games with complex rulesets which require more than 10 minutes to learn. So, making a board game was an interesting challenge. Another thing is that I'm accoustomed to hiding the complex looking formulae behind code, so showing them in an easy to use manner was not that easy, especially with the limited number of pages I could use.

Also, I can only make games and programs if I'm personally interested in using them. To do that, I had imbue the game with my emotions. I wanted to make the players feel increasing amounts of hope and optimism, just as I felt. However, I didn't want them to feel the mental damage. It's not supposed to be that kind of game.

While it may seem like I've been complaining about the limitations, I know that limitations breed innovation. It made me perform quite a few hacks to fit all the content within 7 pages.

= Conclusion
Looking back I feel like the game's success was 6.5/10. It had quite a few problems, but with time, and more playtests, it can become a decent game. It was fun to play the game with my friends. The action cards are a bit boring. I feel like the (admittedly) stupid drawings would've been funny, especially the cat tokens.
